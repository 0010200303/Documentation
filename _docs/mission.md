# Mission

You can think of Missions as "Battles". Missions using a [Scene](scene.md), [MissionViews](missionview.md), and [MissionBehaviours](missionbehaviour.md).

More information on missions will be available once we gain access to the `CampaignSystem` DLLs.

## Tips

* You can get the current mission instance \(if any\) by using `Mission.Current` property.
