# MissionBehaviour

Mission Behaviours are used to control the [Mission](Mission.md). This can be anything from spawning [Agents](Agent.md) to adding boundaries for the Mission.

[MissionLogic](MissionLogic.md) and [MissionViews](MissionView.md) are both types of MissionBehaviours (they inherit MissionBehaviour).
