# The Basics

## Important

Before proceeding, it is important to have a good understanding of the [SubModule.xml](../_xmldocs/submodule.md) file, as this file tells the game what it should be loading when your mod is selected.

## Modding without C\#

There are several aspects of the game you can mod without C\#. This includes scenes, items, cultures, characters, Gauntlet UIs, and many more.

More information on this will be made available once EA is released.
