# ScreenManager

If you plan to do anything Gauntlet-related \(e.g. UIs\), you should familiarize yourself with the Screen Manager.

The Screen Manager can be used to push screens \(which may load [Movies](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Modding/Documentation/tree/e1750735f93f2bf8930a82342deb76c028938da5/_xmldocs/movie.md)\), check which screen is focused or top-most, or pop a screen when you are done with it.
